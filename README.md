# Password-Generator

Project:An employee with access to sensitive data wants to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that they can create a strong password that provides greater security

This respoitory consists of 3 files; html, javascript and css. For this week's homework we were given the starting code. The html and css files were not altered from the original in anyway. There were a few bits of code in the javascript file to create a button however everything else was coded in. The project successfully allows a user to generate a random password that meets their criteria. It offers 8 - 128 characters of length, upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters. Once the specifications are chosen the password will display in the text box.
